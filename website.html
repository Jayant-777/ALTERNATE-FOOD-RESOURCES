        <h2>Why Alternative Foods?</h2>
        <p>With a growing population and limited resources, exploring alternative food options has become essential.
            Sustainable options like plant-based, lab-grown, and insect-based foods are gaining traction as a way to
            reduce environmental impact.</p>

    <!-- Types of Alternative Foods Section -->
    <section id="types">
        <h2>Types of Alternative Foods</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PLANT BASED PROTEINS</strong> <br><strong>Sources:</strong> Includes foods made from soy (like
                tofu, tempeh, and soy milk), legumes, chickpeas, lentils, and pea protein.<br>
                <strong>Benefits:</strong> These are generally lower in saturated fat and calories than traditional
                meats and provide essential amino acids.<br>
                <strong>Popular Products:</strong> Beyond Meat, Impossible Foods, and other brands use plant-based
                proteins to mimic the texture and taste of meat, catering to vegetarians, vegans, and flexitarians.
            </li><br>
            <li><strong>EDIBLE INSECTS:</strong> <BR><strong>Sources:</strong> Crickets, mealworms, grasshoppers, and
                other insects are rich in protein and other nutrients.<br>
                <strong>Benefits:</strong> Insects are highly sustainable due to their minimal land and water
                requirements and low greenhouse gas emissions compared to livestock.<br>
                <strong>Popular Forms:</strong> Edible insects are commonly found in protein bars, powders, and snacks.
                They are popular as a food ingredient in many cultures and are being integrated into Western diets.
            </li><br>
            <li><strong>LAB GROWN MEAT:</strong> <br><strong>Production Process:</strong> Also known as cultured or
                cell-based meat, it’s grown from animal cells in a controlled lab environment, creating real meat
                without slaughter.<br>
                <strong>Benefits:</strong> Lab-grown meat can significantly reduce environmental impact, water usage,
                and animal suffering associated with traditional farming.<br>
                <strong>Current Developments:</strong> Companies like Memphis Meats and Mosa Meat are pioneering
                lab-grown meats, with products expected to hit the market in the coming years.
            </li><br <li><strong>ALGAE AND SEAWEED:</strong><BR><strong>Types:</strong> Includes spirulina, chlorella,
            nori, kelp, and wakame, all nutrient-rich and harvested from ocean ecosystems.<br>
            <strong>Nutritional Value:</strong> Algae and seaweed are packed with vitamins (like A, C, E), minerals
            (like iron and calcium), and omega-3 fatty acids, making them a potent alternative to land-based food
            sources.<br>
            <strong>Uses:</strong> Seaweed and algae are used in snacks, as salad ingredients, in soups, and as
            supplements. They’re also used to enhance flavor with natural umami.</li>

    <!-- Benefits Section -->
    <section id="benefits">
        <h2>Benefits of Alternative Food Resources</h2>
        <p>Alternative food resources, such as plant-based proteins, lab-grown meats, edible insects, and algae, offer
            significant benefits in terms of sustainability, health, and food security. As traditional food production
            systems struggle to keep up with rising global demand, alternative resources present a lower environmental
            impact. For instance, plant-based foods and lab-grown meats generally require less land, water, and energy
            compared to conventional livestock farming, helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to
            environmental advantages, many alternative food resources are rich in nutrients and offer a healthier
            option, often lower in saturated fats and free from antibiotics and hormones found in some animal products.
            By diversifying food sources, these alternatives also help strengthen food security, making it easier to
            feed a growing population while reducing reliance on single food sources. As technological advancements
            continue, the appeal and accessibility of alternative foods are expected to increase, contributing to a more
            sustainable and resilient food system.</p>

    <!-- Future Potential Section -->
    <section id="future">
        <h2>The Future of Food</h2>
        <p>The future of food is rapidly evolving, shaped by new technologies, environmental challenges, consumer demand
            for healthier options, and a focus on sustainability. Here is an in-depth look at how food is changing and
            where it is headed:<br><br>

            <strong>ALTERNATE PROTEINS AND LAB GROWN-MEAT</strong><br>
            <strong>Plant-Based Proteins:</strong> Alternatives to meat, such as those made from peas, soy, and mung
            beans, have become popular due to the reduced environmental impact. Companies like Beyond Meat and
            Impossible Foods are leading the way, creating plant-based products that mimic the taste and texture of
            meat.
            <strong>Cultured Meat:</strong> Lab-grown meat, produced from animal cells, is set to become a significant
            part of the food supply. It requires less land and water and has a lower carbon footprint than traditional
            meat. While costly and technically challenging now, improvements in cell-culture technology may make it
            widely accessible.<br>
            <strong>Insect Protein:</strong> In many cultures, insects are a staple source of protein. Companies are
            exploring insect-based products as a sustainable protein source that requires less space and water, and
            releases fewer greenhouse gases.<br><br>

            <strong>VERTICAL FARMING AND URBAN AGRICULTURE </strong><br>
            <strong>Indoor and Vertical Farms:</strong> To meet urban demand and reduce transportation, vertical farms
            in urban areas are gaining traction. These farms use hydroponics or aeroponics, consuming less water and
            space than traditional farming. Controlled environments also allow year-round production.<br>
            <Strong>Urban Agriculture:</Strong> Rooftop gardens, community gardens, and urban farms make cities
            self-sufficient by
            producing local food and reducing dependency on rural farms.<br><br>

            <strong>SMART AGRICULTURE AND PRECISION FARMING</strong><br>
            <strong>Drones and Satellite Imagery:</strong> monitor crop health, irrigation levels, and soil quality,
            while satellite data provides insights on weather patterns and crop health on a larger scale, improving
            yields and resource management. <br>
            <strong>IoT and Sensors:</strong> Sensors monitor soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient levels, helping
            farmers optimize inputs like water and fertilizers. IoT-connected devices automate many aspects of farming,
            improving efficiency and sustainability. <br><br>

            <strong>FOOD AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE</strong> <br>
            <strong>Climate-Resilient Crops:</strong> Biotechnology enables the development of crops that can withstand
            extreme weather, pests, and diseases. Crops like drought-resistant wheat and flood-tolerant rice are
            essential for future food security. <br>
            <strong>Regenerative Agriculture:</strong> Farmers are adopting practices that enhance soil health, increase
            biodiversity, and capture carbon in soil. This approach reverses the damage from intensive farming and
            creates more resilient agricultural systems. <br><br> 

            <strong>PERSONALIZED NUTRITION AND FOOD TECHONLOGY</strong> <br>
            <strong> Diets:</strong> Advances in genomics and nutrigenomics offer personalized nutrition plans based on
            individual genetic profiles, helping people meet dietary needs and manage health issues more effectively. <br>
            <strong>Functional Foods:</strong> Foods fortified with additional nutrients, probiotics, or antioxidants
            are gaining popularity. These foods provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition, catering to the rising
            demand for wellness-oriented diets. <br>
            <strong>Food Printing and Customization:</strong> 3D food printing allows for personalized shapes, sizes,
            and even nutrient compositions, creating custom meals that cater to individual dietary preferences and
            restrictions. <br>
